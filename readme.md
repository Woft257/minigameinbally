# Mini Game in Bali - User Guide

Welcome to the Mini Game in Bali! This application is designed to provide a fun and interactive experience for all participants. Here's how you can get started and enjoy the game.

## 1. Getting Started

Simply open the application, and you'll be ready to join the fun!

## 2. User Guide

The game is divided into several sections, which you can easily switch between using the tabs at the top of the screen.

### 2.1. Chat Section
This is where you can communicate with other players in real-time.
-   **Sending Messages**: Type your message in the box at the bottom of the screen and press the send button (paper airplane icon). Your messages are limited to 500 characters.
-   **Reading Messages**: Messages from other players will appear on the left, and your messages will appear on the right. You'll see the sender's name and their country (if available).
-   **Scrolling**:
    -   When you first enter the chat, it will automatically scroll to the very bottom so you can see the latest messages.
    -   If new messages arrive while you are already at the bottom of the chat, the screen will smoothly scroll down to show them.
    -   If you scroll up to read older messages, the chat will keep your position, so it won't jump down automatically when new messages arrive. This allows you to read comfortably without interruption.
-   **Loading Older Messages**: As you scroll to the very top of the chat, older messages will automatically load, and your view will remain stable so you can continue reading from where you left off.
-   **Input Area**: The message typing area is solid, ensuring a clean look by hiding the scrollbar behind it.
